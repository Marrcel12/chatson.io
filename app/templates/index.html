                <div class="stepDetails">We believe that everyone has the right to anonymous correspondence. 
                    That is why we decided to create a system that will be easy to use, and at the same time will provide a fully private conversation. 
                    To which no one has access except people who know the room id and the encryption key</div>

                <div class="stepTitle">Invite your friend</div>
                <div class="stepDetails">To chat with another person completely anonymously, 
                    enter the same room id and then the same encryption key.
                    Additionally, we recommend using a VPN and connecting from trusted networks and do not save cookies to avoid other hacker attacks.
                    Good practise is using our service through VPN and in incognito mode.</div>

                <div class="stepDetails">
                    In the first step you have to choose or create/enter your own conversation room id. 
                    We use it to connect you with another person with the same key.
                    If you lost key, you will lost your conversation, also If someone steals your access key, 
                    she/he will only have to guess the encryption key, 
                    which will make it much easier to access your data.
                    <br>
                    <br>Remeber to keep both keys safe and make them complex and hard to guess!</br>

                <div class="stepDetails">That's where we're gettin' started. 
                    After entering room id, you will join to the room. In the top right corner 
                    you have to enter the message encryption key. This key <b>is not saved </b>on the server. 
                    You keep it in your clien side.
                    After sending the message, the server receives an already encrypted message by your key. 
                    So none even us cannot read it without key.

                    If you decide to save your conversation we are going to save it in our safe databse. 
                    All data is encrypted with your key and after it additionally encrypt with our key. 
                    Saved chat are linked only with your room code and encryption key. <b>We do not save any information such as IPs or other identification data </b>

                <div class="stepTitle">You are safe</div>
                <div class="stepDetails">We do not collect any logs, about who connects to our server,
                     and the encrypted chat that is stored with us on the server is worth nothing without user encryption keys.
                     If a leak occurs or our server has been hijacked, 
                     your chats are securely encrypted and impossible to read without your key.
                     The ciphers we use are approved and used by the NSA to protect top secret data.
                     So if your encryption code is not hijacked from your computer or disclosed to an inappropriate person, you are completely safe.
